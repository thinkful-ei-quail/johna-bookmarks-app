Bookmarks App

Live Example: <https://thinkful-ei-quail.github.io/johna-bookmarks-app/>

Required Implemented Features:

* I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
  * title
  * url link
  * description
  * rating (1-5)
* I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
* All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
* I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
* Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
* I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list
* I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
* I can select from a dropdown (a &lt;select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection


Bonus Implemented Features:

* I can change the rating of an existing bookmark
* I can view and/or change any user's bookmarks by changing the query portion of the URL. For example, JaneLane's bookmarks are at <https://thinkful-ei-quail.github.io/johna-bookmarks-app/?JaneLane>
* I can link to a specific bookmark using the fragment identifier (hash sign); for example, if JaneLane had a bookmark with id 1, I could link to it with <https://thinkful-ei-quail.github.io/johna-bookmarks-app/?JaneLane#header-1>. When the page loads, the requested bookmark is expanded and scrolled into view.
